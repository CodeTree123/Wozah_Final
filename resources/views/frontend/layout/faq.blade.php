                    In nail tech programs around the country, students learn how to perform manicures and pedicures to clean, trim, and buff their client's nails – but that's not all the job involves. To be successful in the field, nail technicians must also hold a great deal of knowledge about sales, customer service, and safety and sanitation.

                        <li> Apply to a nail technician program.
                            Applicants typically need to be at least 16 years old and possess a high school diploma or GED.

                            Students must complete a state-approved program combining coursework and training hours. Some states allow students to take on apprenticeships instead, but you’ll usually need to fulfill more training hours. Many programs can be completed in under one year.
                        </li>
                        <li>Pass the required exam and obtain licensure.
                            Typically, this will be a written and/or practical exam. Requirements, including how many training hours you need, will vary by state.
                            After obtaining a nail tech license, each state requires continuing education classes to ensure you’re keeping up to date on all treatments and trends.

                    Unlike licensure qualifications, the requirements for enrolling in barber school typically don't vary much from state to state. You'll need to be at least 16 years old and have a high school diploma or an equivalent credential, like a General Education Diploma (GED).

                    You might also have to pass a background check. The way criminal history is handled varies by state. Some states prevent you from earning a license if you've been convicted of a crime. Others do not, but rather, it depends on whether the crime was a felony or misdemeanor and, possibly, on the severity of the crime.

                    Once you complete your program, it's time to apply for licensure from your state governing body. You'll have to submit all necessary prerequisites, like proof of age, education, and proof that you've passed your program and completed all the required training hours. Next, you'll have to take a comprehensive exam. This varies by state.

                    Barber school generally costs between $10,000 and $20,000. This wide range is due to a number of factors.

                    <br>
                    The length of the program, determined by your state's required number of training hours, could impact the overall cost. Another variable is your location—schools in expensive urban areas tend to cost more than programs in rural areas. Finally, programs that include tools, supplies, textbooks, mannequins, and other materials in their tuition will be more expensive.

                    Licensing laws, rules and regulations vary from state to state, and that can make understanding your rights and responsibilities very confusing. Not to worry. Beauty Schools Directory has spoken with every state in the country about their specific regulations on everything from renewal to reciprocity, and we have compiled that information on this easy-to-read and easy-to-understand page.

                    <br>
                    Cosmetology licensing laws and requirements vary by state, as do reciprocity and transfer regulations, renewal schedules, fees and continuing education requirements. Almost every state has a cosmetology license, but each state differs on whether they offer barber, esthetician, nail technician, makeup artist, permanent makeup artist, electrolysis, instructor and hair braiding licenses.

                    <br>
                    We review every state board each year to ensure we have the most up-to-date information about laws and license requirements possible. We also recommend directly contacting the cosmetology licensing board or other regulating authority in your state, as they can answer questions for your specific situation. If you click the link above, we include complete contact information for each state's licensing board, including an address, phone number, e-mail address and a map to the location.

                    The information you find listed within each state is the latest data that Beauty Schools Directory has on file for each state board of cosmetology's licensing requirements. Hours and minimum requirements are subject to change as laws change. It's especially important to check this information for cosmetology licensing renewal and if you will be transferring your cosmetology license to another state. Often times when transferring your cosmetology license to another state, they have different licensing laws that you will need to meet. Please contact the appropriate state board licensing agencies in your home state and the state to which you're moving to make sure you understand the license transfer process.

                    Whether you are pursuing your overall cosmetology license, or a more specific specialty certification like an esthetician license or hairstylist license, there are some consistent steps in the process across each discipline. In order to get licensed or certified for the beauty specialties in your state, it all begins with education. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    
                    As of 2015, most states require you to attend an approved school for a minimum number of hours, get hands-on training in the student salon or clinic, and sit for the state's board exams. A few states allow apprenticeship in lieu of school to get those training hours. 
                    <br>
                    <br>

                    Once you have passed the board exams specific to your state, you are required to renew regularly. Some states require continuing education hours to renew your beauty license, some require taking a safety and sanitation quiz to renew, and others simply require the license renewal fee.
